Welcome to my page! Hi, my name is Jarrod. I have made this site for a few different reasons. I wanted to have a place where all of my Wife and Iâ€™s adventures are, memories, projects that I/we have worked on, my music, other art, lots of pictures, and to also write some helpful/teaching articles on certain topics.
